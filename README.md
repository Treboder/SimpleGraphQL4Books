# Getting Started
Implementation based on [Tutorial found on www.graphql-java.com](https://www.graphql-java.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-spring-boot/)

### Versions and Dependencies
Spring Boot 2.7.3, using spring-boot-starter-graphql as single dependency for GraphQL.

### History and Migration
Before Spring Boot 2.7.0 the two dependencies: 
* graphql-spring-boot-starter (5.0.2), together with
* graphql-java-tools (5.2.4))

... have been used along with implementation of the two interfaces GraphQLQueryResolver and GraphQLMutationResolver.
Both are not required/supported since Spring Boot 2.7.0 and replaced with Annotations.  

Also see [blog.devgenius.io](https://blog.devgenius.io/graphql-with-spring-boot-starter-graphql-7b406998c0b5)
where migration to 2.7.0 from earlier versions is described.

### Example Query
Navigate to http://localhost:8080/graphiql and place following query:
```
{
    bookById(id: "book-1"){
        id
        name
        pageCount
        author {
            firstName
            lastName
        }
    }
}
```
